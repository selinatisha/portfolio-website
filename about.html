            <b class="bold">My love for knitting/crocheting</b>
            <br />
            I have a passion for knitting and crocheting that has been an
            interest of mine since I was a young teen. It all began with the
            gentle guidance of my beloved sister, who introduced me to the world
            of needles, yarns, and endless possibilities. For me, knitting and
            crocheting are not just hobbies; they are cherished forms of
            self-expression and artistic exploration. From the rhythmic click of
            the needles to the delicate dance of the crochet hook, each stitch
            carries with it a story, a sentiment, a piece of my soul intricately
            intertwined with every fiber. What I adore most about this craft is
            its ability to transport me into a realm of boundless creativity.
            Whether I'm crafting cozy scarves, intricate blankets, or whimsical
            amigurumi, every project is a canvas waiting to be adorned with my
            imagination.

            <b class="bold">World of wonders</b>
            <br />
            As a web developer, my passion for crafting digital experiences is
            rooted in my lifelong love of fantasy books. From the young age when
            I first delved into the realms of magic and wonder, I've been
            captivated by the imaginative landscapes and enchanting characters
            that populate these pages. My journey into the world of fantasy
            began early. With each book I read, my imagination increases.
            Reading became more than just a hobby; it was a gateway to
            creativity and self-discovery. Through the pages of fantasy novels,
            I learned to envision new possibilities, to think outside the box,
            and to embrace my own unique perspective. As I honed my skills as a
            web developer, this love for creativity and imagination became
            ingrained in my approach to coding. Just as a fantasy author weaves
            together elements of magic and adventure to craft a compelling
            story, I harness the power of technology to bring digital dreams to
            life. So, while my passion for coding drives me to push the
            boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm, it's my love for
            fantasy books that fuels my creativity and shapes who I am as a web
            developer.

            <b class="bold">The start of my coding journey</b>
            <br />
            This passion for Web-Developement was ignited by my sister, who is a
            software developer herself. Her expertise, guidance, and unwavering
            support have been instrumental in shaping my path in the world of
            development. Before diving into web development, I used to work as a
            caregiver. As rewarding as it was, it just wasn't scratching that
            creative itch I had. So, I made the leap into coding. Coming from a
            background as a caregiver, I yearned for a career that would provide
            both intellectual stimulation and creative fulfillment. My
            transition from caregiving to web development was not without its
            challenges, but my passion for the craft and the unwavering support
            of my sister propelled me forward. Today, as I continue to evolve
            and grow in this dynamic field, I am grateful for the opportunity to
            pursue a career that fulfills me intellectually and allows me to
            make a meaningful impact through my work.
